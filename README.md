The aim of this project is to collect possible pitfalls you might step in by using [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org/index.html) not in the intended manner.

All cases are moved into their own submodules to keep related files close to each other.

Following submodules exist

 * [camel-test-spring](camel-test-spring/)<br>
 using XML Spring configuration and an AdviceWithRouteBuilder implementation
